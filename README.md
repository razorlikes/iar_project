# Integration-Architectrues-MEAN-Template

This template is meant to support students getting started with the Integration Architectures project.

## Prerequisites
 1. You need a Node.js runtime. It is available at: https://nodejs.org/ .
    
    Please download a version >14.x.x (The current LTS version 14.18.x works, but also the newest version 16.11.x should
    be fine).
 2. Access to a MongoDB server is necessary. If you don't have one already, you should download the community server at:
    https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community .
    
    Upon installation, I would recommend you to select, that MongoDB
    Compass should also be installed. It's a nice GUI-application for managing MongoDB Servers and Databases.

## Setup

 1. Cloning this git repository

 2. Installing dependencies
